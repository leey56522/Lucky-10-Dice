This is a React game where the player rolls 10 dice until all dice get the same number. The player can hold the dice so that the held dice don't change their value when the player presses reroll button.

The score decreases by 500 each time the player rerolls. Player is lost when the score reaches 0.

The game throws confetti to congratualte the player at the end of the game.



## Upcoming changes
1. The unheld dice changes background color to light grey when the player's cursor hovers over it 
2. Make the score decrease exponentially to increase the game difficulty

## Things I learned
1. Using functional components in React
2. Use of useEffect and useState hooks
3. Using local storage to store variables
4. Use of react libraries, such as react-confetti
