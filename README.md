# Tenzies

This is a React game where the player rolls 10 dice until all dice get the same number. The player can hold the dice so that the held dice don't change their value when the player presses reroll button.

The game throws confetti to congratualte the player at the end of the game.

## Upcoming changes
1. Add a scoreboard with highest score stored in local storage
2. The player starts with 10000 points. Each time the player rolls the dice, the score is deducted by 500-1000 points. The game ends when the player reaches 0 points or when the player gets all 10 dice with the same value.
3. The unheld dice changes background color to light grey when the player's cursor hovers over it 

## Things I learned
1. Using functional components in React
2. Use of useEffect and useState hooks
